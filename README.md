# Ecommerce

## About

### What is it?

Ecommerce is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to "watchlist".

### Why I did this?

-   To practice SQL data modeling
-   Get familiar with Django framework
-   Handle basic CRUDs

### Technically

This small project uses Django as backend framework, (Django integrated) SQLite as database and Django templates as client-side views.
